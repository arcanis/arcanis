Hi there! ðŸ˜¸

My name's MaÃ«l and I'm a senior software engineer, currently focusing on developer experience (how to improve developer productivity while making the application more stable?). I jumped into this role back in 2017 when I joined Facebook after years of startups, then kept doing it after moving to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). As part of my role (and also because I like it ðŸ˜‰), I make a LOT of contributions to the open-source.

If you want to support me, feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arcanis) (it gives me a wider reach, and thus makes it easier to promote my project updates), or wait until I finally enable this magic Sponsor button. Also feel free to drop me an email!

## My work on Yarn

I've been Yarn's BDFL for a few years now (since 2017, approximately). More recently I [completely rearchitectured and rewrote the software](https://dev.to/arcanis/introducing-yarn-2-4eh1), which was a huge undertaking as you can imagine. Fortunately, I've been helped in this endeavor by the arrival of new contributors, finally building the community I dreamt of. Speaking of which, we're always open to new contributors, so ping me on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg) if that might be you!

Finally, I'm also the designer and implementer for Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) - so if you see me tell you that you shouldn't rely on hoisting, do me a favour and trust me! After all this time, I feel like I could write a thesis about package management ðŸ˜„

## Other projects

I love to learn by practice, and since I started my journey I touched a bit of everything: full websites, [compilers](https://github.com/castel/), [emulators](http://arcanis.github.io/pokelib/example/), [terminal interfaces](https://github.com/manaflair/mylittledom), ...

My two main libraries at this point in time are [Clipanion](https://github.com/arcanis/clipanion), a CLI framework, and [Typanion](https://github.com/arcanis/typanion), a runtime type assertion library. I also have a secret project I hope to show you one day ... one more reason to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arcanis)! ðŸ’«
